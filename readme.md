## Summary
- 
## Problem
- This product allows teachers and students to keep track of grades. This problem is experienced by all grade-keeping schools. We intend to simplify the experience for both parties because grades are important as they keep students updated on their performance. 
## Solution
- We intend to simplify grading for teachers and provide a better log in experience for students. 
## Key Technical Challenge
- The most challenging technical hurdle will be connecting the front end with the backend to make reliable and consistent API calls and being able to communicate efficiently with our database.
## Extension Opportunities
- Adding a parents log in page where parents can also view their child's grades and can leave comments.
