## Sub-Heading
- The Gradebook for teachers, students and parents to keep track of student grades and report progress to parents.
## Summary
- Simplify the grading process, get deeper insights into day-to-day assessments, and improve student outcomes with end-to-end communication for a better understanding of what students are achieving in the classroom. Connect students, teachers, administrators, and parents with the shared goal of improving student outcomes. This is a technology that helps educators and students realize their full potential in their way.

## Problem
- This product allows teachers and students to keep track of grades. This problem is experienced by all grade-keeping schools. We intend to simplify the experience for both parties because grades are important as they keep students updated on their performance. 
## Solution
- We intend to simplify grading for teachers and provide a better log in experience for students. 
## Key Technical Challenge
- The most challenging technical hurdle will be connecting the front end with the backend to make reliable and consistent API calls and being able to communicate efficiently with our database.
## Extension Opportunities
- Adding a parents log in page where parents can also view their child's grades and leave comments.
